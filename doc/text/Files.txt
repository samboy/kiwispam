About this document

   This is a quick start guide, geared towards experienced users of the
   Unix operating system. More detailed instructions are in the file
   Start.html.
   
Files included with Kiwi

   This is a basic description of some of the files in the kiwi package,
   and how to use them.
   
   example_kiwirc
          This file needs to be copied to your home directory and given
          the filename .kiwirc. This file tells the Kiwi software whether
          you have a sendmail or qmail system, the location of your mail
          spool and/or the address you want to forward "good" mail to,
          the log file to use, the encryption key, and the password so
          friends can email you without needing to know an encrypted
          cookie. You also need to decide on whether to forward "good"
          mail on, or append it to a mailbox you specify.
          
   secpass
          Located in the directory tools, secpass is used to generate a
          random key for the encryption, to be placed in the kiwi_key
          field in .kiwirc (using cut and paste). This program will only
          run on an operating system with /dev/random support, and with a
          copy of the perl interpreter in /usr/bin/perl. Any modern Linux
          distribution will have /dev/random support and perl located at
          /usr/bin/perl.
          
   clicrypt
          Depending on how this is run, this gives you cookies which
          timeout after a certain number of days, an encrypted 28-bit IP
          subnet, or a five-letter message.
          
          When run with no arguments, you are given three cookies: One
          which times out (by default) in three days, one which times out
          in two weeks (this one is usually used for Usenet postings),
          and one which times out after 90 days.
          
          Example: clicrypt
          
          You can change the timeout values by varying kiwi_days_short,
          kiwi_days_mid, and kiwi_days_long in your .kiwirc file.
          
          If you send out an email with the return address
          name+cookie@domain.com (or name-cookie@domain.com on Qmail
          systems), the email address will time out.
          
          To encrypt an IP subblock, either set up the 'REMOTE_ADDR'
          environmental variable (or run it as a SSI on most web servers)
          or give it an IP on the command line. Details on using ipcrypt
          on an SSI-enabled web browser are in the file Webmailto.html.
          
          Example: clicrypt 127.0.0.1
          
          This program can also be used to encrypt a five-letter message,
          typically used for subscribing to announce mailing lists, or to
          give to people of marginal trust.
          
          Example: clicrypt abcde
          
   decode
          This will tell you the contents of a given cookie. To use,
          simply run it, type in the cookie and hit return.
          
   infilter
          This is the program you would place in .forward (or .qmail and
          .qmail-default on qmail systems) that determines if a message
          was sent to a valid cookie (or has the correct password in the
          email address), and if so, either appends your mailbox with the
          message in question, or forwards it to another email address
          you have. If the cookie was rejected, then it discards the
          message and makes a note in your maillog file.
          
          A cookie will be rejected if the cookie does not decrypt to
          valid data (a randomly generated cookie has a 1 in 113 chance
          of being considered valid data), or if the time stamp in the
          decrypted cookie has expired.
          
          If kiwi_password is defined in .kiwirc, and someone sends mail
          with the password in place of the encrypted cookie in the
          address, the message will be accepted. This is useful for
          giving personal friends an easy to remember email address. Care
          must be taken that the email address with the password does not
          fall in to spammers' hands.
          
   wrapper
          This is a sendmail wrapper, which will append a 90-day timeout
          cookie to your return address in all outgoing mail you send.
          The procedure for using this wrapper to send out mail instead
          of sendmail depends on your client. If using Pine, add a line
          like this to your .pinerc file:
          
     sendmail-path=/usr/local/bin/wrapper -t
     
Example of using Kiwi

   Example of using Kiwi:
   $ cd ../src
   $ cp exmaple_kiwirc ~/.kiwirc
   $ ../tools/secpass
   If it pauses here, please type some random text to replenish the
   random seed
   Random password with 96 bits of entropy: jzsmGA.Mtep7-tDD
   [Paste the password generated by secpass (Not the above example
   password), and put it in the kiwi_key field when you edit .kiwirc]
   $ pico -w ~/.kiwirc [edit the .kiwirc file]
   $ make [you will get a number of compiling messages]
   $ ./clicrypt
   fmx2v6v [The exact text will be different on your system]
   $ ./clicrypt 127.0.0.1
   eqjq2b4 [The exact text will be different on your system]
   $ ./decode
   fmx2v6v [Use the text you got from clicrypt above]
   Data type: Long timeout
   Message: 905972880, or Wed Sep 16 12:08:00 1998 [Your date will be
   different]
   $ ./decode
   eqjq2b4 [Use the text you got from clicrypt above]
   Data type: Truncated IP
   Message: 127.0.0.0-16
