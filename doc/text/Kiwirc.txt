                               The .kiwirc file

   The  .kiwirc  file is used by the Kiwi spam-protection program to read
   configuration  information.  The  location  of  the  .kiwirc  file  is
   determined thusly:
     * If  the  environmental  variable  KIWIRC  is defined, the value of
       KIWIRC is the location of the kiwirc file.
     * Otherwise, if the environmental variable HOME is defined, look for
       a file named .kiwirc in the directory HOME points to.
     * Finally,  determine  the uid that the kiwi spam-protection process
       is running as (using geteuid), find out the home directory of that
       uid, and look for a .kiwirc file there.

   The Kiwirc file has the following syntax:
     * Lines  containing a # character do not parse any information at or
       after  the # character. In other words, comments in a .kiwirc file
       are  started with the # character. Exception: When the # character
       is  quoted  (Example:  "#"),  the hash is treated does not begin a
       comment.
     * Lines  exist  in  one  form:  A  variable  name  (containing  only
       alphanumeric  characters),  followed  by  zero or more white space
       characters (space or tab), followed by an = sign, followed by zero
       or  more  white  space  characters,  followed by the value for the
       variable  (either  quoted  with the " character or containing only
       alphanumeric characters).

   An alphanumeric character is one of the following:
     * A letter in the English language, either upper case or lower case
     * A number in the English language
     * The character - or _

   The  following  variable  names  are accepted by version 2 of the Kiwi
   spam protection suite:

     kiwi_qmail
     kiwi_sendmail_path
     kiwi_days_short
     kiwi_days_mid
     kiwi_days_long
     kiwi_forward
     kiwi_append
     kiwi_my_mailbox
     kiwi_my_address
     kiwi_maillog
     kiwi_key
     kiwi_password
     kiwi_mid_process
     kiwi_bouncemail
     kiwi_utf8_output
     kiwi_inbound_process

   The meaning of the variable names are as follows:

kiwi_qmail

   If  set to TRUE, this tells the Kiwi spam protection suite that we are
   running  Qmail  instead  of  Sendmail.  Cookies  are  delimited by a -
   instead  of  a  +,  and  the  environmental variable DTLINE is used to
   determine what email address an incoming message was delivered to.

kiwi_sendmail_path

   The  location  of  sendmail on our system. On Linux systems, this will
   usually  have the value /usr/sbin/sendmail. On most other Unices, this
   will generally have the value /usr/lib/sendmail.

kiwi_days_short

   The  number  of  days before a message with a short timeout times out.
   This number is an integer.

kiwi_days_mid

   The  number  of days before a message with a medium timeout times out.
   This number is an integer.

kiwi_days_long

   The  number  of  days  before a message with a long timeout times out.
   This number is an integer.

kiwi_forward

   If  set  to  TRUE,  accepted  mail  is forwarded to the address set by
   kiwi_my_address.  This should not be set to TRUE if kiwi_append is set
   to TRUE.

kiwi_append

   If  set  to  TRUE,  accepted  mail  is appended to the file pointed to
   kiwi_my_mailbox. This should not be set to TRUE if kiwi_forward is set
   to TRUE.

kiwi_my_mailbox

   The file to append if kiwi_append is set to TRUE.

kiwi_my_address

   The  email  address to forward mail to if kiwi_forward is set to TRUE.
   If kiwi_mid_process or kiwi_inbound_process is set, this is the single
   argument given to the respective process.

kiwi_maillog

   The  log  file  used by Kiwi to make a note of messages that have been
   rejected.

kiwi_key

   The encryption key used by Kiwi.

kiwi_password

   If  the  Kiwi  cookie  someone  uses  to  send  mail  has the value of
   kiwi_password,  the  message is accepted without checking the value of
   the cookie.

kiwi_mid_process

   If a message is accepted by the Kiwi software suite, and the encrypted
   cookie  is  a MID TIMEOUT cookie, and this value is set to a non-blank
   value,  then the accepted message will be piped to the program pointed
   to  by  kiwi_mid_process  with  a  single  argument  of  the value for
   kiwi_my_address.   This   overrides   the   value   of   kiwi_forward,
   kiwi_append,  and  kiwi_inbound_process in the case of messages with a
   MID TIMEOUT cookie.

kiwi_bouncemail

   If  a  message  is  not  accepted  by  the  Kiwi  software  suite, and
   kiwi_bouncemail  is  set,  then  the  person  sending the message will
   receive  a copy of the file pointed to by kiwi_bouncemail, followed by
   the message they sent.

kiwi_inbound_process

   If a message is accepted by the Kiwi software suite, and this value is
   set  to  a non-blank value, then the accepted message will be piped to
   the  program pointed to by kiwi_inbound_process with a single argument
   of  the  value  for  kiwi_my_address.  This  overrides  the  value  of
   kiwi_forward and kiwi_append.

kiwi_return_path

   If  this  is  set,  the Return-Path header of all mail sent out by the
   Kiwi  software  suite  is  set  to this value. If this is not set, the
   Return-Path  header of all mail sent out by the Kiwi software suite is
   set to 'nobody@example.com'. Since some machines' spam filters require
   a  domain  the  resolves  in  the return path, this should be set to a
   known email address, perhaps one that silently discards mail.

   Note:  This  only  works  on  Qmail systems. On sendmail systems, give
   sendmail  an  argument  of -f, followed by the desired return-path, to
   change the return-path.

kiwi_utf8_output

   If  this  is  set  to  "TRUE",  Kiwi will output utf-8 when displaying
   decoded  cookies  with five-letter messages instead of the default iso
   8859-1
