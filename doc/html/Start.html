<A NAME=about>

<H2>About this document</H2>

<P>

The purpose of this document is to guide you through setting up a basic
Kiwi-enabled mailbox on a system that is compatible with the Kiwi software
package.

<A NAME=compat>

<H2>Kiwi-compatible systems</H2>

In order to use the Kiwi package (described in <A
href=Intro.html>Intro.html</A>), you will need the following:

<UL>

<LI> A Unix-compatible system.

<P>
<LI> An internet connection with a static IP, or access to an ISP shell
     account.

<P>
<LI> Said machine needs to be the primary mail exchanger for at least
     one host name.  If you have an ISP shell account, it will usually
     have this.

<P>
<LI> The machine needs to use either the Qmail mail transport agent (MTA),
     or a recent version of the Sendmail MTA with '+' addressing, where
     name+word@domain.com is equivalent to name@domain.com.  Other MTAs
     which support sendmail-style + addressing will also work with Kiwi.

<P>
<LI> You will need a mail user agent that can change the location of the
     sendmail mail transport agent.  With some mail user agents, you will
     need to recompile the program to change this location.

<P>
<LI> While your choice of login shell will not affect the functionality
     of Kiwi, the shell commands shown here assume use of the GNU Bash
     shell.

</UL>

<P>

The Kiwi package has been tested on the following systems:

<UL>

<LI> A RedHat Linux 5.2 system running Qmail

<P>
<LI> A RedHat Linux 6.2 system running Qmail

</UL>

<P>

There is no guarantee that Kiwi will compile, much less run, on other,
untested Unix systems.  People that try to get Kiwi to run on unlisted
systems are encouraged to email me their successes or failures.

<A NAME=setup>

<H2>Setting up Kiwi</H2>

<A NAME=mta>

<H3>Determine your Mail Transport Agent</H3>

<P>

You need to determine if your system is running Qmail or Sendmail.  To do
this, type in the following command at the Unix prompt:

<P>

<CODE> $ <B>telnet localhost 25</B></CODE>

<P>

If you see something similar to:

<P>

<CODE>
Trying 127.0.0.1...<BR>
Connected to localhost.<BR>
Escape character is '^]'.<BR>
220 host.domain.com ESMTP <EM>Sendmail</EM> 8.8.5-r-beta/8.8.5/(v1.02);
Mon, 5 Oct 1998 09:11:36 -0700 (PDT)<BR>
</CODE>

<P>

Then you are running a Sendmail system. (Note the word Sendmail above)

<P>

If you see something similar to:

<P>

<CODE>
Trying 127.0.0.1...<BR>
Connected to localhost.<BR>
Escape character is '^]'.<BR>
220 host.domain.com ESMTP<BR>
</CODE>

<P>

Then you are running a Qmail system.

<P>

To exit from this telnet, type in the following:

<P>
<CODE><B>QUIT</B></CODE>
<P>

This will terminate your telnet session.

<P>

If you see a response different from either of the above responses, then
you are running a system that is neither Sendmail nor Qmail.  The Kiwi
system is currently only tested on Sendmail and Qmail systems.

<A NAME=isplus>

<H3>Determining + addressing ability (Sendmail systems)</H3>

<P>

Qmail users may skip to the <A href=#makekey>next section</A>.

<P>

If your system is a system running the Sendmail mail transport agent, you
will need to determine if you system has the ability to utilize '+'
addressing.

<P>

To determine this, you will need to send a message to yourself.

<P>

Using the Mail User Agent of your choice, be it Elm, Pine, Berkeley Mail,
Mutt, XFMail, Kmail, or any other Mail User Agent, send mail to an address
in the form:

<P>
<CODE><I>user</I>+word<I>@host.domain.com</I></CODE>
<P>

Where <I><CODE>user@host.domain.com</CODE></I> is your email address.  For
example, if your email address was:

<P>
<CODE>fred@example.com</CODE>
<P>

You would send email to <CODE>fred+word@example.com</CODE>.

<P>

Next, after a wait of five minutes or so, check your mailbox.  If you
received the message sent to
<CODE><I>user</I>+word<I>@host.domain.com</I></CODE>, then your system has
'+' addressing support, and should be compatible with Kiwi.  If, instead,
you got a message from <CODE>Mailer-Daemon</CODE> indicating that the
email address <CODE><I>user</I>+word<I>@host.domain.com</I></CODE> does
not exist, than you system does not have '+' addressing support, and is
incompatible with Kiwi.

<A NAME=makekey>

<H3>Creating a Kiwi encryption key</H3>

<P>

In order to use Kiwi with adequate security, it is important to set up an
encryption key that is difficult to guess.  People on Linux (or any other
system with <CODE>/dev/random</CODE> support) systems with Perl installed
may use the <CODE>secpass</CODE> program in the <CODE>tools/</CODE>
directory to generate a secure encryption key.

<A NAME=secpass>

<H4>The secpass program</H4>

<P>

To run the <CODE>secpass</CODE> program, enter the <CODE>tools/</CODE>
directory, and type in the following command at the shell prompt:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<CODE><B>./secpass</B></CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

The output should be similar to the following:

<P>
<CODE>
If it pauses here, please type some random text to replenish the random seed
<BR>
Random password with 96 bits of entropy: jzsmGA.Mtep7-tDD
<BR>
</CODE>
<P>

Make a note of the random password, or key.  On some systems, this can be
done by pasting the key in to the clipboard. 

<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> It is important to paste the key actually generated
by <CODE>secpass</CODE> in to the clipboard, and to <EM>not</EM> paste the
above example key in to the clipboard.

<P>

<A NAME=nosecpass>

<H4>Generating a key on a system which can not run secpass</H4>

Some systems will not be able to run the <CODE>secpass</CODE> program.

<P>

People on such systems will need to generate their own random key.  A key
should have the following characteristics:

<UL>

<LI> The key should be between 16 and 28 characters in length

<P>
<LI> The key should <em>not</em> be based on a dictionary word, any known
     personal information about you, a quotation, or anything else that
     could possibly be guessed.

<P>
<LI> The key should be completely random letters, numbers, and
     punctuation.

<P>
<LI> The key should not use the punctuation symbol <CODE>"</CODE>.  This is
     not for security reasons, but to avoid syntax errors in the file
     <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE>

</UL>

<P>

Once a suitable key is determined, the key should be noted.  Again, this
can be done by pasting the key in to the clipboard on many systems.  We
will apply use this key in the next step. 

<A NAME=config>

<H3>Editing your .kiwirc file</H3>

<P>

In the directory <CODE>src/</CODE>, there is a file named
<CODE>example_kiwirc</CODE>.  This file needs to be copied to a file
with the name <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> in your home directory, as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>cp example_kiwirc ~/.kiwirc</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

There are a number of fields in this file that need to be changed before
the Kiwi software suite can be compiled.  In order to change these fields,
the file needs to be edited with a text editor.  One such editor is the
<CODE>pico</CODE> editor.  To edit the <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file with
this editor, enter your home directory, and type in the
following command: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>pico -w .kiwirc</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Some fields need to be changed in the <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file.

<P>

<A NAME=pastekey>

<H4>Paste in the encryption key</H4>

<P>

The encryption key, as determined above, needs to be pasted in the key
field.  This field is near the bottom of the <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file.  

<P>

Take the line that looks like this:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
</CODE><P>

And make it look like this:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_key = "</CODE><I>encryption key</I><CODE>"
</CODE><P>

Where <I>encryption key</I> is the encryption key generated above.  Be
sure to have quotes around the encryption key (as seen above).

<A NAME=whichmta>

<H4>Are we running Qmail or Sendmail?</H4>

If you are running a Sendmail system, as opposed to a Qmail system (see
above), you will need to comment out the line that looks like:

<P>
<CODE>kiwi_qmail = "TRUE"</CODE>
<P>

So that it looks like:

<P>
<CODE># kiwi_qmail = "TRUE"</CODE>
<P>

<H4>Do we want to forward this to another email address, or append this to
    our mailbox?</H4>

<P>

Unless you have another email address you wish to have mail that Kiwi
accepts delivered to, you will want to set up Kiwi to append mail to your
mailbox.

<P>

To set up Kiwi to append mail to your mailbox, you will need to determine
the location of the mailbox on your system.  This can usually be
determined by the following shell command:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>echo $MAIL</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

On Qmail systems, this will be in the form 
<CODE>/home/username/Mailbox</CODE>.  If this is in the form
<CODE>/var/spool/mail/username</CODE>, you will not be able to
set up Kiwi to append mail to your mailbox.  Instead, append it to
a file with a name like <CODE>/home/username/.mailbox</CODE>.

<P>
<em>Note:  If you are a system adminstrator that wishes to allow users to
append mail to /var/spool/mail</em>username<em> in a secure manner, please
look at the dropmail program in the Kiwi src directory.</em>

<P>

Paste the above filename using the clipboard functionality of your system,
and replace the line that looks like:

<P>
<CODE>kiwi_my_mailbox "/var/spool/mail/yourusername"</CODE>
<P>

With a line that looks like:

<P>
<CODE>kiwi_my_mailbox = "</CODE><I>mailbox</I><CODE>"</CODE>
<P>

Where <I>mailbox</I> is the location of your mailbox, as determined above. 
Be sure to have quotes around the mailbox location (as seen above). 


<P>

In addition, you will need to change the behavior of Kiwi from forwarding
to a valid email address to appending to your mailbox. 

<P>

To do this, change the line that looks like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_forward = "TRUE"
</CODE><P>

To look like:

<P><CODE>
# kiwi_forward = "TRUE"
</CODE><P>

And change the line the looks like:

<P><CODE>
# kiwi_append = "TRUE"
</CODE><P>

To look like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_append = "TRUE"
</CODE><P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> It is important to have only one of either kiwi_forward
or kiwi_append set to TRUE.  Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> have both 
kiwi_forward and kiwi_append set to TRUE.

<A name=sendloc>

<H4>The location of Sendmail on your system</H4>

You will need to determine the location of the sendmail program, used to
send out mail, on your system.  On most systems, the default value,
<CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE> will function.  On some Linux systems,
however, this will need to be changed to <CODE>/usr/sbin/sendmail</CODE>.

<P>

To determine if <CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE> is present on your system,
type in the following command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ls -l /usr/lib/sendmail
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you get output like:

<P><CODE>
---s--x--x  3 root       589824 Sep 15  1997 /usr/lib/sendmail
</CODE><P>

or

<P><CODE>
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           18 Oct  1 14:47 /usr/lib/sendmail
-> /usr/sbin/sendmail
</CODE><P>

then <CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE> is a valid path for sendmail on your
system.  

<P>

If, on the other hand, you got a reply to the above <CODE>ls -l</CODE>
like:

<P><CODE>
ls: /usr/lib/sendmail: No such file or directory
</CODE><P>

Then sendmail is not located at <CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE>.  On such
systems, sendmail is often located at <CODE>/usr/sbin/sendmail</CODE>, and
this can be determined with the <CODE>ls -l</CODE> command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	ls -l /usr/sbin/sendmail
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where the output is similar to the above possible <CODE>ls -l</CODE>
outputs.

<P>

Once you determine the location of sendmail on your system, change the
line that looks like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_sendmail_path = "/usr/lib/sendmail"
</CODE><P>

To look like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_sendmail_path = "</CODE><I>location of sendmail</I><CODE>"
</CODE><P>

Where <I>location of sendmail</I> is the location of sendmail on your
system.  On systems where sendmail is located at
<CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE>, the above line does not need to be edited. 

<P>

<A NAME=logloc>

<H4>Determining the location of Kiwi's log file</H4>

<P>

If you wish to look at a log of messages rejected by Kiwi's mechanism, you
will need to determine the location of your home directory.  To have
Kiwi's log be a file called <CODE>.maillog</CODE> off of your home
directory, type in the following shell command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	echo ~/.maillog
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The output of this command should look something like
<CODE>/home/username/.maillog</CODE>.  Once you determine this file name
and location, change the line in <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> that looks like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_maillog = "/home/yourusername/.maillog"
</CODE><P>

to look like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_maillog = "</CODE><I>location</I><CODE>"
</CODE><P>

Where <I>location</I> is the location of <CODE>~/.maillog</CODE>, as
determined above.

<A NAME=password>

<H4>Determining a password</H4>

<P>

This step is an optional step.

<P>

You may wish to allow personal friends to be able to email you without
them needing to know a valid encrypted cookie.  Kiwi has <I>password
support</I> to allow this.  

<P>

If you have a Kiwi password set up, someone can send mail to an address in
the form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>user+<B>password</B>@host.domain.com</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and have Kiwi accept the mail in question.  In the above example address,
<I>user@host.domain.com</I> is your base email address, and
<B><I>password</I></B> is your Kiwi password. 

<P>

To set up a Kiwi password, determine a suitable password.  A suitable
password should be a single word that is easy to remember, but hard to
guess.  The password should not contain any spaces nor any punctuation.

<P>

Once you choose a suitable password, edit <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> so
that the line that looks like:

<P><CODE>
# kiwi_password = "changeme"
</CODE><P>

looks like:

<P><CODE>
kiwi_password = "</CODE><I>password</I><CODE>"
</CODE><P>

Where <I>password</I> is the password that you have chosen.

<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> On Qmail system, the password-accepted email has
this form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <I>user-<B>password</B>@host.domain.com</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

note the <B>-</B> instead of a <B>+</B>.

<A NAME=compile>

<H3>Compiling the Kiwi package</H3>

After editing the <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file, Kiwi can be compiled on most
systems by simply typing in the command

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
	make
</B></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

To install Kiwi in to <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>, type in this command next:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
	make install
</B></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As an aside, you can determine the type of Unix system you have with this
command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
	uname -a
</B></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME=outmail>

<H3>Adding a Kiwi encrypted cookie in outgoing mail</H3>

<P>

To add a Kiwi-encrypted cookie to the return email address on your
outgoing mail, set up your mail user agent to send mail via the
<CODE>wrapper</CODE> program, instead of directly using sendmail.  The
procedure for doing this depends on where you wish to place the
<CODE>wrapper</CODE> program, and on the mail user agent that you use.

<P>

If you use the Pine mail user agent to read and send mail, edit the file
<CODE>.pinerc</CODE> in your home directory so that it has the following
line: 

     <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
     sendmail-path=/usr/local/bin/wrapper -t
     </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Note that Pine 3.89 is not compatible with the Kiwi package, since you can
not tell Pine 3.89 to use another program as your sendmail program.  More
recent versions of Pine are compatible with Kiwi.

<P>

Note also that Pine has a lot of security problems, since it was not written
with security in mind.  You may be better off using <CODE>mutt</CODE> to read
mail.  <CODE>Mutt</CODE> has a mode that closely emulates the behavior of
Pine.

<P>

After setting up your mail user agent to send mail through the Kiwi
sendmail wrapper instead of through sendmail, it is important to test
things to verify that an encrypted cookie is added to your return address
in outgoing mail.  To do this, simply send yourself a message.

<P>

The return address on the message you just sent yourself should be in the
form: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>user+</CODE><I>cookie</I><CODE>@host.domain.com</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>user@host.domain.com</CODE> is your email address and
<I>cookie</I> is an encrypted cookie that looks like <CODE>2gbn5tn</CODE>
or <CODE>gq4y5ci</CODE>.  For example, the return address may look like
<CODE>fred+3qhstr7@example.com</CODE> if your normal email address is
<CODE>fred@example.com</CODE>.  

<P>

On Qmail systems, the return address will be in the form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>user-</CODE><I>cookie</I><CODE>@host.domain.com</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Observe a '-' symbol instead of a '+' symbol used to separate the cookie
from the username. 

<A NAME=inmail>

<H3>Setting up Kiwi to filter your incoming mail</H3>

<P>

This is the most dangerous part of setting up Kiwi.  Once this is set up,
<STRONG>all email sent to the Kiwi-enabled email address with neither a
valid cookie nor the correct password will be discarded</STRONG>.  In
addition, it is possible to lose mail if Kiwi's incoming mail filter is
incorrectly set up.

<P>

The procedure for doing this varies, depending on whether you are using a
Sendmail system or you are using a Qmail system.  

<A NAME=inmail_s>

<H4>Setting up Kiwi's incoming mail filter on a Sendmail system</H4>

<P>

To set up Kiwi's incoming mail filter on an older Sendmail system, set up the
<CODE>.forward</CODE> file in your home directory to direct mail to Kiwi's
incoming mail filter.  Using an editor, edit your <CODE>.forward</CODE>
file to look like this: 

     <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	"|/usr/local/bin/infilter"
     </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <I>your home directory</I> is the location of your home
directory.

<P>

You can also change <CODE>.forward</CODE> to use Kiwi's mail filter 
by typing in the following command at a Unix shell prompt:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
	echo \"\|/usr/local/bin/infilter\" > ~/.forward
</B></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<EM>Note:</EM>Nerwe versions of Sendmail only accept MTAs in a certain
directory.  The Kiwi package does not support newer Sendmail systems
yet.

<P>

Note that you need to install Kiwi with <CODE>make install</CODE> to have
the <CODE>.forward</CODE> file function correctly.

<A NAME=inmail_q>

<H4>Setting up Kiwi's incoming mail filter on a Qmail system</H4>

<P>

To set up Kiwi's incoming mail filter on a Qmail system, set up the
<CODE>.qmail</CODE> and the <CODE>.qmail-default</CODE> file in your home
directory to direct mail to Kiwi's incoming mail filter.  Using an editor,
edit both your <CODE>.qmail</CODE> and <CODE>.qmail-default</CODE> file to
look like this: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
        "|/usr/local/bin/infilter"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <I>your home directory</I> is the location of your home
directory.

<P>

You can also change <CODE>.qmail</CODE> and
<CODE>.qmail-default</CODE> to use Kiwi's mail filter 
by typing in the following two commands at a Unix shell prompt:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
        echo \"\|/usr/local/bin/infilter\" > ~/.qmail <BR>
	cp ~/.qmail ~/.qmail-default
</B></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Note that you need to install Kiwi with <CODE>make install</CODE> to have
the <CODE>.qmail</CODE> and <CODE>.qmail-default</CODE> files function
correctly. 

<A NAME=invrfy>

<H4>Verifying that Kiwi's incoming filter works</H4>

<P>

Now that you have set up your mailbox to forward mail through Kiwi's
incoming filter, <STRONG>it is very important to verify that the incoming
mail filter is functioning correctly</STRONG>.  

<P>

To do this, reply to the test message you sent to yourself above.  The
return address in the message you reply to needs to have a valid Kiwi
cookie between the '+' (or '-') symbol and the '@' symbol.  (See the
section on setting up Kiwi as a Sendmail wrapper for outgoing mail for
example Kiwi cookies). 

<P>

After you reply to the message with a valid Kiwi cookie, wait five
minutes, and check to see if the message was delivered to your mailbox.
Assuming the message was delivered (see below if it was not), verify that
Kiwi's incoming mail filter correctly discards messages without a valid
cookie.

<P>

Send a message to yourself, without including either a valid Kiwi cookie
nor your Kiwi password (if you have one).  The message should not be
delivered to you, and the file <CODE>.maillog</CODE> in your home
directory should have a record of the message not being delivered. 

<A NAME=inbad>

<H4>Action to take if Kiwi's incoming filter does not function</H4>

<P>

If Kiwi's incoming filter is not working on your system, disable Kiwi's
incoming filter with the following command on a Sendmail system: 

	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><B>
	rm ~/.forward
	</BLOCKQUOTE></CODE></B>

<P>

To troubleshoot why the message was not delivered, you may wish to look at
the file <CODE>.maillog</CODE> in your home directory to see if the
message was rejected.  You may also, if you have another email account,
enable Kiwi's incoming mail filter again, send the Kiwi-enabled account a
message, and see if mail sent to you bounces (In other words, the mail is
returned to the sender as undeliverable). 

<P>

There are many factors that may cause the incoming filter to act
incorrectly, and a comprehensive troubleshooting guide is beyond the scope
of the manual.  You should contact your system administrator if Kiwi's
incoming filter continues to not properly function.

<A NAME=misc>

<H2>Further capabilities of Kiwi</H2>

<P>

At this point, Kiwi should be functioning on your system.  Kiwi has a
number of other features, such as the ability to have permanent encrypted
cookies that you can use to subscribe to mailing lists, the ability to
encrypt IPs, which you can use to trace how spammers obtained emails on
your web page, and the ability for different messages to have different
time-out periods. 

<P>

These features are briefly touched on in the file <A
href=Files.html>Files.html</A>.  I hope that you find Kiwi a useful tool
to help protect your mailbox from unwanted spam email.
