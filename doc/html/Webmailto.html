<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>

Frequently, people with web pages wish to make their email address
available on the World Wide Web.  Unfortunately, it is common for bulk
emailers to run automated programs that obtain email addresses from web
pages.  With the list of obtained email address, the bulk mailer sends out
unwanted commercial email.

<P>

One way of approaching this problem is to configure the web server to look
for programs of that nature hitting the web server, and redirect all such
request to the output of programs like <A
href=http://www.e-scrub.com/wpoison/>Wpoison</A>.  Wpoison is a program
the generates random, nonfunctional email address, which makes the use of
programs that automatically gather email addresses on the web ineffective. 

<P>

While programs like Wpoison are very effective when we can determine that
it is an email-addressing gathering program hitting our web server, many
such programs will carefully disguise their nature. 

<P>

Kiwi can be utilized so as to help us further thwart such programs.  The
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program can be used in a <I>server
side include</I> to trace where people are gathering email addresses.  (A
<I>server side include</I> is a feature most web servers have that allows
web pages to run programs to determine their content.) 

<P>

This allows us to determine where someone obtained an email address to
send us unwanted mail.  We can take necessary action.  For example, we
could look at our web server logs to find out when they obtained the email
address in question, or simply filter out any connections from that
machine. We could also, on Qmail systems, disable the email address that
they obtained by their email address gathering program.

<P>

The use of Kiwi-enabled addresses on web pages gives us more
flexibility in handling automated programs that gather email address on
web pages.  The rest of this document describes how to implement these
features.

<A NAME=require>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>

In order to have Kiwi-enabled email addresses on your web pages, you need 
the following:

<UL>

<LI>Kiwi compiled on the web server in question

<LI>A web server that sets the environmental variable 
   <CODE>REMOTE_ADDR</CODE> to contain the IP used to view an SSI-enabled
   web page.  Most (if not all) SSI-enabled web servers will do this.

<LI>SSI enabled on the web server in question.

<LI>Access to the SSI mechanism of the web server you wish to have
    a Kiwi-enabled email address on.

</UL>

<A NAME=html>

<H2>Making a web page with a Kiwi-enabled email address</H2>

<P>

The HTML code to a <CODE>mailto:</CODE> link with a Kiwi-enabled address
will look something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

&lt;A HREF=mailto:user+&lt;!--#exec 
cmd="/home/yourusername/clicrypt_wrapper"--&gt;@host.domain.com&gt;

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>user@host.domain.com</CODE> is your email address before the
Kiwi cookie is added to it, and 
<CODE>/home/yourusername/clicrypt_wrapper</CODE> is a small program what
will change the <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> environmental variable, and then call
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE>.

<P>

Note that the above html will only function in an SSI-enabled web page.

<A NAME=clicrypt>

<H2>The clicrypt program</H2>

<P>

The <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program is one of the programs included with the
Kiwi software suite.  It is compiled when the Kiwi suite is compiled.  See
the file <A href=Start.html>Start.html</A> for information on how to set
up and compile the Kiwi suite.

<P>

By default, <CODE>make install</CODE> places <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> in 
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>
directory with the name <CODE>clicrypt</CODE>. 

<A NAME=kiwirc>

<H2>The .kiwirc file</H2>

The <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program looks for a <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file 
using the following rules:

<UL>

<LI>If the environmental variable <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> is defined, the value
    of <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> is the location of the KIWIRC file.

<LI>Otherwise, if the environmental variable <CODE>HOME</CODE> is defined,
    look for a file named <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> in the directory 
    <CODE>HOME</CODE> points to.

<LI>Finally, determine the uid that the <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> process is 
    running as (using <CODE>geteuid</CODE>), find out the home directory 
    of that uid, and look for a <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file there.

</UL>

<A NAME=wrapper>

<H2>Making a wrapper for clicrypt</H2>

On most web servers, ssi pages are run as the <CODE>nobody</CODE> user,
which means, instead of calling <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> directly from the 
ssi-enabled webpage, we run a <I>wrapper program</I> which does the
following two things:

<UL>

<LI>Sets the <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> environmental variable

<LI>Runs the <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program

</UL>

Here is what such a program would look like if written in C:

<PRE>
main() {
    setenv("KIWIRC","/home/yourusername/hidden/kiwirc");
    execl("/usr/local/bin/clicrypt","clicrypt",(char *)0);
    }
</PRE>

<P>

In the above exmaple program, replace 
<CODE>/home/yourusername/hidden/.kiwirc</CODE> with the path to the 
<CODE>kiwirc</CODE> file you wish <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> to use.  If
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE> is not in its default location 
(<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>), replace <CODE>/usr/local/bin/clicrypt</CODE>
with the path to <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> with the path to <CODE>clicrypt</CODE>
on your system.

<P>

Here is one way of converting the above C code to a wrapper for the
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program:

<UL>

<LI>Type the above program (with the appropriate modifications) in to a 
    file called <CODE>clicrypt_wrapper.c</CODE>
<LI>Compile the above program as follows:

    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>cc -o clicrypt_wrapper clicrypt_wrapper.c</CODE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Have the ssi page point to the above program.

</UL>

<A NAME=security>

<H2>Security considerations</H2>

<P>

In order for this to run, the <CODE>kiwirc</CODE> file in question needs to 
be readable by the user the web server runs ssi scripts as, usually the
<CODE>nobody</CODE> user.  

<P>

For security reasons, this setup should only be run on systems
where you trust the other users on your system.  You can get some level
of protection from untrusted users, by doing the following:

<UL>

<LI>Placing the .kiwirc file in a hidden directory:
    <OL>
    <LI>Creating a directory off of your home directory called 
        <CODE>hidden</CODE>
    <LI>Making the directory <CODE>hidden</CODE> unreadable by other users
        on your system with <CODE>chmod 711 hidden</CODE>
    <LI>Placing a directoy in the the direcotry hidden with a 
        difficult-to-guess name, such as <CODE>kgu23y34nvcmnq</CODE>
    <LI>Placing the kiwirc file in that directory.
    </OL>

<LI>Write a program in C that points <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> to the
    hidden directory.
<LI>Compiling the C program (see above for details)
<LI>Making the C program unreadable by other users with
    <CODE>chmod 711 clicrypt_wrapper</CODE>
<LI>Pointing the ssi page to <CODE>clicrypt_wrapper</CODE>
</UL>

Note that some versions of Unix have ways of reading a binary file with
711 permissions, so this method is not always secure.

<P>

<A NAME=testing>

<H2>Testing the web page with the Kiwi enabled address</H2>

<P>

Go to the web page containing the Kiwi-enabled email address.  Verify
that the SSI correctly created an email address with a Kiwi cookie.
Next, send a message to the address on the web page.

<P>

Once you get the message, look at the email address the message was sent
to.  You may have to enable viewing of full headers on your mail user
agent to do this. 

<P>

The email address the example mail sent to yourself above will be in this
form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>
user+cookie@host.domain.com
</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>user</CODE> is your username, <CODE>cookie</CODE> is an
encrypted cookie that looks like <CODE>2gbn5tn</CODE> or
<CODE>gq4y5ci</CODE>, and <CODE>host.domain.com</CODE> is the host and
domain name portion of your email address.

<P>

To the information stored in the email address' cookie, type in the
following commands at a Unix shell prompt:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>
$ /usr/local/bin/decode<BR>
</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>/usr/local/bin/decode</CODE> is the location the decode
symlink to the clicrypt binary is located.  Use the
cut and paste functionality of the environment your mail user agent is in
to paste the above cookie.

<P>

The next step is to use the paste functionality of your environment to
paste the above cookie.  After pasting the above cookie, hit the return
key.

<P>

The output from the <CODE>decode</CODE> program will look something like
this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	Data type: 28BIT IP BLOCK<BR>
	Message: 192.168.12.32/28
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The message portion of deocde's output will contain, within a range of 16
ips, the ip that you viewed the web page from.  (The reason for the 16-ip
range is because the Kiwi specification does not give us a finer
resolution.) 

<P>

With this information, you can look at the logs, and determine when and
where someone obtained the email address in question.
