<H1>Handling emails sent to bad Kiwi cookies</H1>

<P>

It is possible that someone will inadvertently send mail to an email
address with a bad Kiwi cookie.  For example, an acquaintance may send us
a message to an address that has expired, or someone may have incorrectly
copied a Kiwi-enabled email address.

<P>

By default, Kiwi silently discards messages that do not have a valid cookie.
However, it may be more desirable for you to be able to have Kiwi send
people who send email to an address with a bad cookie a bounce message,
informing them that they need to send a message to an email address with
a correct Kiwi cookie.

<P>

Kiwi has support for <I>BOUNCEMAIL</I> which allows Kiwi to send a reply to
a message with an invalid Kiwi cookie.  In order to use this feature, do the
following:

<UL>

<LI>Set up a form letter to send to people who email an incorrect Kiwi cookie.

<P>
<LI>Have the variable <I>kiwi_bouncemail</I> in <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> point to
    that file.

</UL>

The form letter should have the following characteristics:

<UL>

<LI>The form letter should inform the user that the message in question was
    not delivered to you.

<P>
<LI>The form letter needs to have, at the top of the message, a return address
    and a subject header.  There should be at least one blank line between the
    headers and the body of the message.

<P>
<LI>In order to stop mail loops, the form letter should have a return address
    that silently discards mail.  The <CODE>nobody</CODE> email address on 
    many systems does this.  An example <CODE>nobody</CODE> email address is
    <CODE>nobody@example.com</CODE> (this particular email address does not
    work, and is only shown as an example of a nobody email address)

<P>
<LI>Since Kiwi will append the form letter with a copy of the undelivered
    message, the form letter should end with a note indicating that the
    remainder of the message is the undelivered message.

</UL>

Here is an example form letter.  Please change <CODE>nobody@example.com</CODE>
to a working email address that silently discards mail before using this
example:

<P>

<PRE>
From: nobody@example.com
To: nobody@example.com
Return-Path: nobody@example.com
Reply-To: nobody@example.com
Subject: Your mail was not delivered

[In order to stop mail loops, replies to this message are silently discarded]

Hello there,

You mail was not delivered to me for a number of possible reasons.  Possible
reasons include:

* The email address you sent mail to timed out

* The email address you tried sending mail to was incorrectly copied
