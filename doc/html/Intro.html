<H1>The Kiwi spam-protection package</H1>

<P>

The popularity of the internet has caused numerous people, often of
questionable legality, to send out mass emails, or <I>spam</I> to as many
addresses as these people can find. 

<P>

No rational person wishes to receive such email in their mailbox.  One
common technical solution is for people to modify the email address they
use to post to newsgroups in to an invalid email address.  It is usually
obvious to a human looking at the email address what the actual email
address is, but a computer program run by a spammer to obtain email
addresses will not obtain the email address in question.  A look at most
Usenet newsgroups shows that this is a very common practice.  This
practice is called <I>munging</I>.

<P>

Munging, while effective, has a number of downsides:

<P>

<UL>

<LI> Munging is against traditional internet nettiquette.  This can be
     seen, for example, in Usenet2, where munging is expressly forbidden.

<P>
<LI> Munging makes it more difficult for moderates who need to send out
     a large number of rejection messages in a short period of time.

<P>
<LI> Munging makes it difficult for people to respond via email to Usenet
     postings.

<P>
<LI> The practice of munging encourages people to not have their email 
     address altogether in their postings.  This encourages anonymity,
     which results in a lower signal to noise ratio in discussion groups.

</UL>

We can see that munging is, in many ways, undesirable.  For many people,
however, making their private email address available to the world every
time they have a "mailto" link on their web page or post to Usenet is not
a viable option. 

<P>

The <I>Kiwi</I> package provides a method of allowing one to send out
email with a valid return address, without placing one's personal email
address on spammers' lists.  The way it works is by taking an email
address in the form

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>

	name@domain.com

</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

and converting it to the form

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>

	name+</CODE><I>cookie</I><CODE>@domain.com

</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where the <I>cookie</I> is a short (32-bit) encrypted message that can
contain information such as:

<P>
<UL>

<LI> The date and time an email was sent out or an article was posted.
     This allows us to have email addresses time out after a set period
     of time--Three days, two weeks, or 90 days, depending on where the
     email address is being made public.  This way, while spammers can
     obtain a temporary email address of ours, the email address quickly
     becomes worthless.

<P>
<LI> The ip someone views a "mailto" link from.  This allows us to find
     out where spammers obtain email addresses on web pages from, and
     take action on this information.

<P>
<LI> A five letter code.  This code can be used as an email address that 
     we use to subscribe to a list.  Should the email address get spam, we
     can inform the mailing list manager that a spammer is mailing list
     members, and change the address we have subscribed to the list.
