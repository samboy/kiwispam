<H1>Kiwi Specification Version 1.9.03</H1>

<A name=terms>
<H2>Terminology</H2>

<P>

The kiwi 32-bit encrypted message will be called, in this paper, a
<I>cookie</I>. 

<P>

A person attempting to cryptoanalyze this spec will be called a
<I>spammer</I>.  Each cookie will have 32 bits of encrypted data, and
three bits of parity. 

<A name=plaintext>
<H2>Determining the plaintext</H2>

The 32 bits of plaintext has two sections: 

<UL>

<LI> A 4 bit (or longer) header telling us the kind of data being 
encrypted. 

<P>
<LI> 28 (or less) bits of data

</UL>

<P>

The header field currently can have one of the following data types:

<UL>

<LI> A four-bit header of "1000" ('8' in hex), "1001" ('9' in hex), or "1010"
  ('A' in hex) indicates that the remaining 28 bits are a unix time stamp
  with 28 bits of accuracy (the time stamp increments every 16 seconds).
  The reason why the time stamp increments so quickly is because this
  is the default stamp used for outgoing mail/news, and we want each
  mail to almost always have a different stamp.  When the 4-bit header is 8,
  we want the email address to have a short (72 hour) time out, when the
  4-bit header is 9, we want a medium (2 week) timeout, and when
  the 4-bit header is A, we want a long (90 day) timeout.

  <P>

  Messages posted to Usenet should have a 2-week timeout header.  The Kiwi
  package has the capacity to give messages with a 2-week timeout to a
  separate mail filtering agent.  This allows us, to for example, pipe
  such messages through the Procmail mail filtering agent, or through any 
  of the various anti-spam filters.

<P>
<LI> A four bit header of "1011" ('C' in hex) indicates that the remaining 28
  bits are the 28 most significant bits of the IP used to view a given
  email address.  This would typically be used on a web page, where the
  email address on the web page would tell us where the person obtained the
  email in question.

<P>
<LI> A 12-bit header of 0x7ff in hex indicates that the remaining 20 bits is a
  timestamp that changes every 4096 seconds.  Useful for crypto mirrors where 
  you want to change the location every hour or two.  

<P>
<LI> An 8-bit header of 0x7e will, in a future release of Kiwi, contain a
     24-bit IP block, similiar to the 28-bit IP block a header of "1011" (C)
     gives us.

<P>
<LI> A 7-bit header of 0x7c (or 0x7d) indicates that the remaining 25 bits 
  are a five-letter "mailing list" designation, useful for permanent 
  addresses you only want to give to one party.  Should you get spam
  to one of these addresses, you can track where the spam came from.

  <P>

  Each letter takes up 5 bits, using a similiar mapping as the <A
  href="#5bit">binary-to-ascii map</A> below.  However, in contrast to
  the binary-to-ascii map, there are no numbers in this mapping.  Instead,
  the last six spots use non-English letters, as follows:

<PRE>

11010           0x1a         á
11011           0x1b         é
11100           0x1c         í
11101           0x1d         ó
11110           0x1e         ú
11111           0x1f         ñ

</PRE>
  
  The first letter of the message is the left five bits of the 25-bit 
  message, the second letter is the right five bits of the left 10 bits, 
  and so on.

<P>
<LI> A 6-bit header of 0x78 (Which covers 0x78, 0x79, 0x7a, and 0x7b) 
     indicates that the remaining 26 bits are a password which changes every
     64-seconds.  This is useful for setting up security systems where you
     want to have access be dependent on both the end-user knowing a password
     and on having a portable program (Running on a Palm-sized or smaller
     device) that can determine the one-minute password.

<P>
<LI> A decoded cookie with the value of 0x00000000 indicates that an
     error occured (out of memory, etc.) when we attempted to parse the 
     Kiwi cookie.

<P>
<LI> A decoded cookie with the value of 0x00000001 indicates that, when
     we parse the cookie, we got a bad parity, or some other form of
     invalid data, which needs to be rejected by the Kiwi program.

<P>
<LI> A decoded cookie with a value of 0x00000002 indicates that the cookie
     should be accepted (usually because the "cookie", such as it is, is 
     actually a valid password)

<P>
<LI> A decoded cookie with a 4-bit header of '3', '4', '5', or '6' may be 
     used for any purpose deemed suitable by someone making their own
     version of Kiwi.  These headers will not be used by any official release
     of the Kiwi software suite.

</UL>

<P>

I have this idea that is not yet implemented:

<UL>

<LI> A four bit header of "1011" ('B' in hex) indicates that the remaining 28
  bits are divided in to a 16-bit hash of the subject line of the message,
  and a 12-bit time stamp (This gives us a time stamp that increments
  every 12.14 days).  This allows us to discard any replies that do not
  have the subject in the header, or are older than a given age (+/- six
  days)

</UL>

This is a chart of various headers in the Kiwi spec and the kind of message

<A name=parity>
<H2>Calculating the parity</H2>

<P>

The three parity bits are calculated with the 32-bit plaintext, where each
parity bit XORs 1/3 of the bits in the plaintext.  The purpose of the
parity bits is to make it 8 times as difficult for a spammer to generate a
random cookie that decrypts to valid data. 

<P>

The parity bits are calculated thusly:

<PRE>

        +--+---+--+--+---+--+--+---+--+------- Bit one of parity
        |  |   |  |  |   |  |  |   |  |
        V  V   V  V  V   V  V  V   V  V
Data: xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
      ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^ ^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^
      || || ||  || || | | || ||  || || ||
      +|-+|-+|--+|-+|-+-|-+|-+|--+|-+|-+|----- Bit two of parity
       |  |  |   |  |   |  |  |   |  |  |
       +--+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+--+----- Bit three of parity

</PRE>

Where each bit of parity is an XOR of one third of the bits in the 32-bit
plaintext data field.  You may also imagine a + in the above diagram as an
XOR operation.

<A name=crypto>
<H2>Encrypting the plaintext</H2>

<P>

The plaintext is encrypted with a 32-bit variant of the Blowfish
encryption algorithm.  In this variant, we can have a key up to 28 bytes
(224 bits) long, encrypt blocks that are 32-bits long, and have 16 entries
each 16 bits long in the four s-box tables. The s-box tables use a total
of 128 bytes, as opposed to 4096 bytes in the full 64-bit blowfish.

<P>

We use 16 rounds, and have 18 P-boxes, each of which is 16 bits long.  The
P-boxes and S-boxes combined take up a total of 164 bytes of memory.  As
opposed to the 521 encryptions that the full 64-bit Blowfish uses to
initialize the P-boxes and S-boxes, this variant of Blowfish only needs to
perform 41 encryptions. 

<P>

The initial values for the P and S boxes are as follows:

<PRE>

<A name=ascii>
<H2> Converting the binary ciphertext in to an ASCII cookie</H2>

<P>

The 32-bits of ciphertext and three bits of parity are converted in to a
7-digit ASCII string.  Each digit in the string corresponds to five bits
of data in the ciphertext and/or parity.

<P>

The 32 bits of ciphertext and three bits of parity are divided thusly:

<P>

<CODE>X</CODE>: single bit of ciphertext<BR>
<CODE>P</CODE>: Single bit of parity

<PRE>


                        /+-+++------------- Second byte of ASCII cookie
             /+++-+-----||-|||------------- Byte four of ASCII cookie
  /++++------||||-|-----||-|||------------- Byte six of ASCII cookie

                              \++++-------- First byte of ASCII cookie

</PRE>

<P>

In other words, the first bite of the ASCII cookie is determined by the 
right five bits of the ciphertext.  The second byte of the ASCII cookie
is determined by the left five bits of the right ten bits of the 
ciphertext.  The third byte of the ASCII cookie is determined by the left
five bits of the right 15 bits of the ciphertext.  The fourth byte of the
ASCII cookie is determined by the left five bits of the right 20 bits of
the ciphertext.  The fifth and sixth byte of the cookie are determined by
similar means.

<P>

The seventh, and final, byte of the ASCII cookie is determined by both the
left two bits of the ciphertext, and the three bits of parity.  The right
two bits of the final cookie byte are determined by the left two bits of
the ciphertext, where the most significant bit of the ciphertext
determines the second-least significant bit of the seventh cookie byte. 
The left three bits of the final ASCII cookie are determined by the three
parity bits, where the left-most bit of the cookie byte is determined by
bit one of parity (see parity section above), the second bit from the left
in the cookie byte by the second parity bit, and so on.

<P>

We convert five bits of binary data into ASCII using the following table:

<P>

Note that we do not have the numbers '0' and '1' in the mapping.  This is
to avoid confusion with the letter 'o' and the number '0', and the letter
'l' and the number '1'.

<H2> Test Vectors </H2>

<P> 

Test vectors for the Kiwi specification are available in the file
<A href=Test_vectors.html>Test_vectors.html</A>.

<A name=password>
<H2> Password-protected email addresses </H2>

<P>

For email addresses to give to friends, we have support for special email
addresses, in the form joe+password@domain.com (or
joe-password@domain.com), where the end user determines the password. 
Mail sent to a password protected email address will be delivered without
attempting to decrypt the cookie. 

<P>

Care should be taken to not make any password-protected email addresses
visible where spammers can obtain the email address.  This includes not
making the email address visible in Usenet posts, web pages, in finger
information, as the address used to subscribe to a mailing list, nor
anywhere else a spammer may obtain the email address.
