<H1>Having Kiwi-enabled email addresses subscribed to mailing lists</H1>

<P>

You may wish to use Kiwi-enabled addresses to subscribe to mailing lists,
be they formal mailing lists, such as Majordomo mailing lists, or informal
mailing lists, such as joke mailing lists to receive jokes.  Another use
of permanent Kiwi-enabled email addresses is to have a valid email address
for use in on-line forms which need a working email address.

<P>

Kiwi allows this by the use of the <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> command.  This
command will generate a permanent Kiwi-enabled email address when given a
five-letter message.

<P> 

The email address contains a five-letter code, which will help you keep
track of what mailing list a given email address is on, should you get
unwanted email.  The five-letter code is encrypted, and can not be seen by
the person who gets the Kiwi-enabled address. 

<P>

To generate a Kiwi-enabled encrypted email address, simply use the
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE> program (usually in <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>) to
generate an encrypted cookie:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	clicrypt </CODE><I>five-letter message</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <I>five-letter message</I> is a five-letter description of the
mailing list in question, such as <CODE>rdhat</CODE> (which you may use if
you wished to subscribe to the RedHat general mailing list) or
<CODE>rhdev</CODE> (which you may use if you wished to subscribe to the
RedHat developer's mailing list). 

<P>

The five letter message needs to be precisely five letters long, and only
contain lowercase letters.

<P>

<CODE>clicrypt</CODE> will output the encrypted cookie on the standard
output--it will be printed out. 

<P>

Once <CODE>clicrypt</CODE> generates an encrypted cookie containing a
five-letter message, you may paste the cookie generated by
<CODE>clicrypt</CODE>, and use the cookie in an email address thusly: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	user+</CODE><I>cookie</I><CODE>@host.domain.com
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>user@host.domain.com</CODE> is your email address without Kiwi
enabled.  Qmail users will have an email address in the form
user-</CODE><I>cookie</I><CODE>@host.domain.com</CODE>.
