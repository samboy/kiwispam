<H1>The .kiwirc file</H1>

<P>

The <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file is used by the Kiwi spam-protection program to
read configuration information.  The location of the <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file
is determined thusly:

<UL>

<LI>If the environmental variable <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> is defined, the value
    of <CODE>KIWIRC</CODE> is the location of the kiwirc file.

<LI>Otherwise, if the environmental variable <CODE>HOME</CODE> is defined,
    look for a file named <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> in the directory 
    <CODE>HOME</CODE> points to.

<LI>Finally, determine the uid that the kiwi spam-protection process is 
    running as (using <CODE>geteuid</CODE>), find out the home directory 
    of that uid, and look for a <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file there.

</UL>

<P>

The Kiwirc file has the following syntax:

<UL>

<LI>Lines containing a <CODE>#</CODE> character do not parse any information 
    at or after the <CODE>#</CODE> character.  In other words, comments in
    a <CODE>.kiwirc</CODE> file are started with the <CODE>#</CODE> character.
    Exception: When the <CODE>#</CODE> character is quoted (Example: 
    <CODE>"#"</CODE>), the hash is treated does not begin a comment.

<LI>Lines exist in one form: A variable name (containing only 
    alphanumeric characters), followed by zero or more white
    space characters (space or tab), followed by an <CODE>=</CODE> sign,
    followed by zero or more white space characters, followed by the value 
    for the variable (either quoted with the <CODE>"</CODE> character or 
    containing only alphanumeric characters).

</UL> 

An alphanumeric character is one of the following:

<UL>

<LI>A letter in the English language, either upper case or lower case

<LI>A number in the English language

<LI>The character <CODE>-</CODE> or <CODE>_</CODE>

</UL>

The following variable names are accepted by version 2 of the Kiwi spam
protection suite:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
        kiwi_qmail<BR> 
        kiwi_sendmail_path<BR> 
        kiwi_days_short<BR>
        kiwi_days_mid<BR>
        kiwi_days_long<BR>
        kiwi_forward<BR>
        kiwi_append<BR>
        kiwi_my_mailbox<BR>
        kiwi_my_address<BR>
        kiwi_maillog<BR>
        kiwi_key<BR>
        kiwi_password<BR>
        kiwi_mid_process<BR>
        kiwi_bouncemail<BR>
	kiwi_utf8_output<BR>
        kiwi_inbound_process<BR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The meaning of the variable names are as follows:

<H2>kiwi_qmail</H2>

If set to TRUE, this tells the Kiwi spam protection suite that we are running
Qmail instead of Sendmail.  Cookies are delimited by a <CODE>-</CODE> instead
of a <CODE>+</CODE>, and the environmental variable <CODE>DTLINE</CODE> is
used to determine what email address an incoming message was delivered to.

<H2>kiwi_sendmail_path</H2>

The location of sendmail on our system.  On Linux systems, this will usually
have the value <CODE>/usr/sbin/sendmail</CODE>.  On most other Unices, this
will generally have the value <CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail</CODE>.

<H2>kiwi_days_short</H2>

The number of days before a message with a short timeout times out.  This
number is an integer.

<H2>kiwi_days_mid</H2>

The number of days before a message with a medium timeout times out. This
number is an integer.

<H2>kiwi_days_long</H2>

The number of days before a message with a long timeout times out.  This 
number is an integer.

<H2>kiwi_forward</H2>

If set to TRUE, accepted mail is forwarded to the address set by 
<CODE>kiwi_my_address</CODE>.  This should not be set to TRUE if 
<CODE>kiwi_append</CODE> is set to TRUE.

<H2>kiwi_append</H2>

If set to TRUE, accepted mail is appended to the file pointed to
<CODE>kiwi_my_mailbox</CODE>.  This should not be set to TRUE if 
<CODE>kiwi_forward</CODE> is set to TRUE.

<H2>kiwi_my_mailbox</H2>

The file to append if <CODE>kiwi_append</CODE> is set to TRUE.

<H2>kiwi_my_address</H2>

The email address to forward mail to if <CODE>kiwi_forward</CODE> is set
to TRUE.  If <CODE>kiwi_mid_process</CODE> or 
<CODE>kiwi_inbound_process</CODE> is set, this is the single argument given
to the respective process.

<H2>kiwi_maillog</H2>

The log file used by Kiwi to make a note of messages that have been rejected.

<H2>kiwi_key</H2>

The encryption key used by Kiwi.

<H2>kiwi_password</H2>

If the Kiwi cookie someone uses to send mail has the value of 
<CODE>kiwi_password</CODE>, the message is accepted without checking
the value of the cookie.

<H2>kiwi_mid_process</H2>

If a message is accepted by the Kiwi software suite, and the encrypted
cookie is a MID TIMEOUT cookie, and this value is set to a non-blank
value, then the accepted message will be piped to the program pointed
to by <CODE>kiwi_mid_process</CODE> with a single argument of the value
for <CODE>kiwi_my_address</CODE>.  This overrides the value of 
<CODE>kiwi_forward</CODE>, <CODE>kiwi_append</CODE>, and 
<CODE>kiwi_inbound_process</CODE> in the case of messages with a MID TIMEOUT
cookie.

<H2>kiwi_bouncemail</H2>

If a message is <I>not</I> accepted by the Kiwi software suite, and 
<CODE>kiwi_bouncemail</CODE> is set, then the person sending the message
will receive a copy of the file pointed to by <CODE>kiwi_bouncemail</CODE>,
followed by the message they sent.

<H2>kiwi_inbound_process</H2>

If a message is accepted by the Kiwi software suite, 
and this value is set to a non-blank
value, then the accepted message will be piped to the program pointed
to by <CODE>kiwi_inbound_process</CODE> with a single argument of the value
for <CODE>kiwi_my_address</CODE>.  This overrides the value of 
<CODE>kiwi_forward</CODE> and <CODE>kiwi_append</CODE>.

<H2>kiwi_return_path</H2>

If this is set, the Return-Path header of all mail sent out by the Kiwi
software suite is set to this value.  If this is not set, the Return-Path
header of all mail sent out by the Kiwi software suite is set to 
'nobody@example.com'.  Since some machines' spam filters require a domain
the resolves in the return path, this should be set to a known email
address, perhaps one that silently discards mail.

<P>

<B>Note:</B> This only works on Qmail systems.  On sendmail systems, give
sendmail an argument of <CODE>-f</CODE>, followed by the desired return-path,
to change the return-path.

<H2>kiwi_utf8_output</H2>

If this is set to "TRUE", Kiwi will output utf-8 when displaying decoded
cookies with five-letter messages instead of the default iso 8859-1
