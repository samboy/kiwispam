<H1>Environmental variables that Kiwi sets</H1>

The Kiwi spam-protection program sets environmental variables in order to
help facilitate it working with other processes.  

<P>

When used as a wrapper for outgoing mail, the environmental 
variable KIWI_STATUS is given the value of "OUTGOING" (without the quotes).

<P>

When used as a filter for incoming data, the following environmental 
variables are set:

<UL>
<LI><B>KIWI_FROM</B>
    <P>
    The environmental variable KIWI_FROM is given the email address that
    the incoming message is from.  This is derermined from the mail headers
    as follows:
    <OL><LI>If there is a <CODE>Reply-To:</CODE> header, set the value
            to the email address visible in the <CODE>Reply-To:</CODE>
            header.
        <LI>Otherwise, if there is a <CODE>From:</CODE> header, then set
            the value to the email address visible in the <CODE>From:</CODE>
            header.
    </OL>
    Note that it is trivial to forge this value.
<P>
<LI><B>KIWI_STATUS</B>
    <P>
    The environmental variable KIWI_STATUS tells the child process 
    whether the message is going out from the sender to the internet,
    coming in from the internet, or if the message is being bounced.
    <OL><LI>If the message is going out to the internet, KIWI_STATUS
            has a value of <CODE>OUTGOING</CODE>.
        <LI>If the message is coming in from the interent, KIWI_STATUS
            has a value of <CODE>INCOMING</CODE>.
        <LI>If a bounce message is being sent to someone who sent mail to
            an invalid Kiwi cookie, KIWI_STATUS has a value of
            <CODE>BOUNCING</CODE>.
    </OL>
<P>
<LI><B>KIWI_DATATYPE</B>
    <P>
    The environmental variable KIWI_DATATYPE tells the child process
    the kind of data the decoded cookie has.  This can have the following
    values: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
SHORT TIMEOUT<BR>
MID TIMEOUT<BR>
LONG TIMEOUT<BR>
28BIT IP BLOCK<BR>
HIDDEN DIR<BR>
FIVE LETTERS<BR>
GOOD PASSWORD<BR>
BAD PARITY<BR>
INVALID<BR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI><B>KIWI_DATA</B>
    <P>
    The environmental variable KIWI_DATA tells the child process
    the kind of data the decoded cookie has.  Depending on the value of
    KIWI_DATATYPE, this will have the following values:

    <P>
    <OL><LI>"SHORT TIMEOUT", "MID TIMEOUT", or "LONG TIMEOUT"
        <P>If the data is one of these three types, then the data will 
           be a single number: A timestampe of when the cookie was sent out,
           in a form of the number of seconds since the epoch
           (Jan 1, 1970, midnight GMT).  For example: "972688017" or
           "176001069".
    <P>
    <LI>"28BIT IP BLOCK"<P>If the data is of this datatype, then the data
        will be, in standard dotted notation, the lowest numbered ip of the
        /28 network in question.  In other words, if the original ip was 
        1.2.3.25, this will have the value of "1.2.3.16".
    <P>
    <LI>"FIVE LETTERS"<P>If the data is of this datatype, then the data
        will be the five-letter message in question.  Example: "rdhat".
    <P> 
    <LI>"GOOD PASSWORD"<P>If the data is of this datatype, then the data
        will be the password in question.
    <P>
    <LI>"BAD PARITY"<P>If the data is of this datatype, then the data
        will contain "N/A".
    <P>
    <LI>"INVALID" and "HIDDEN DIR"
        <P>
        If the data is one of these data types, then the data will be
        undefined

    </OL>
