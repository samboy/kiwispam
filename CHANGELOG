2.0.00: OK, it is time to put this program to rest.  I have been using
        this program for over a year, and the original version of Kiwi for
	two years before that, and have almost certaintly ironed out
	all of the show-stopper bugs in the long time that I have been 
	using Kiwi. 
	
	I have finally done something useful with the six remaining spots 
	in five-letter messages.  While I used to have grandiose plans of 
	having fancy multi-character modifiers, where one code would 
	indicate that the remaining digits were numbers or modified 
	characters, etc, in the end, I ended up simply putting six 
	international characters there instead.  Namely, áéíóúñ: Spanish 
	becuase I'm in México right now.  And, yes, via some ugly hackery, 
	one can input either utf-8 or iso 8859-1 for these characters.  Also, 
	one can specify in the .kiwirc whether to output decoded 5-letter 
	messages in utf-8 or in ISO 8859-1.  The documentation has been
	updated to reflect this new feature.

	Bugfix: email addresses are now case-insensitive when using Qmail.

	I also corrected a documentation error with regards to Postfix.
	In fact, Postfix can support +-style addressing.
	
	In addition, I finally finished the dropmail program, and updated 
	the man pages to be current with the 2.x branch of Kiwi.

        I used to have the original kiwi1 source here.  No longer.  People
	who wish to look at the original kiwi1 source can download the 
	kiwi-1.2.01.tar.gz file (which is the final release of the
	original version of Kiwi).

	This is going to be my final release of Kiwi.  This program never
	"caught on", despite being in existence for more than three years,
	and I'm too busy with other projects (such as MaraDNS) to work
	on this any more.  The only thing that would motivate me to 
	update this package is a security bug worth posting to Bugtraq.

	It is time to move on.

	One complaint that I never resolved is that Kiwi munges (adds cookies 
	to) headers that it should not munge.  I am not going to resolve 
	this issue.  However, if one wishes to add to the headers that are 
	not munged, look for the comment "Various lines in the heaqder we 
	do not munge" in the KiwiMain.c file, and add the appropriate 
	headers that should not be munged there.

	If you wish to become the maintainer of Kiwi, please let me know.

2.0-rc3: Corrected incorrect example in the js_lock and js_unlock
         man pages.  Updated dropmail to use file locking.
         (2001.02.14)

2.0-rc2: Changed compile flag for the JessStr library from -g to
         -O.  Dropmail.c now compiles and makes a simple binary
         with elevated privledges needed top drop mail off in
         /var/spool/mail/name in the case of /var/spool/mail/name
         not existing. (2001.02.13)

2.0-rc1: Made various size structures in the js_string structure 
         unsigned ints, so we do not get unexpected behavior.
         Added dropmail program, which will, before Kiwi-2.0 gold
         gets release, will be documented and tested to work around
         the security problems with a /var/spool/mail/name mailbox
         store method. (2001.02.10)

2.0-beta3: Added note that kiwi_return_path only works on Qmail systems.  
           In order to minimize transcription errors, 1s are now parsed as 
           'l's in cookies, and 0s are parsed as 'o's. (2000.11.21)

2.0-beta2: Significant cleanups in the documentation.  This system has now
           been tested on a sendmail system, and a bug w.r.t. running Kiwi on
           a Sendmail system has been fixed.  Updated "make install" to use
           its own script.  Updated default compile option to -O instead of 
           -g.  Next: Write a secure "file appender" will will append mail
           from the standard input in to /var/spool/mail/username.
           (2000.11.01)

2.0-beta1: Made manual pages for js_open_append, js_lock, js_unlock,
           js_val, js_atoi, js_nonmatch,j s_nonmatch_offset, js_length,
           js_qstr2js, and js_tolower.  Doc freeze: The only changes that
           will be made are corrections to the code and to the documentation.
           (2000.10.30)

0.9.11: Updated CHANGELOG to include changes done in later versions of the
        kiwi-1.x program.  Important bugfix:  Added new kvar, kiwi_return_path
        which is the return-path for the emails the kiwi program sends out.
        This is important because some machines on the internet do not accpet
        mail from machines whose return-path values do not resolve.  Added
        example_kiwirc.html document.
        (2000.10.28)

0.9.10: Fixed bad HTML in Env.html.  Added Env.html to list of files in 
        Intro.html.  Updated publish script. (2000.10.27)

0.9.09: Fixed bug where messages of valid but unknown type were silently 
        discarded.  Now, these messages are bounced.  Finished
        Env.html file.  (2000.10.27)

0.9.08: Made program futureproof by having KIWI_DATA in the case of a
        good password, by setting to the password instead of to "N/A".  
        Began work on Env.html file. (2000.10.26)        

0.9.07: Added more error correction when trying to open files.  Changed
        permissions of src directory to 755 (700 perms no longer needed, 
        now that the .kiwirc file contains the encryption key).  
        Added Kiwirc.html document (2000.10.25)

0.9.06: Feature freeze.  New new features will be added to the code until
        the Kiwi-2.0.00 release.  Corrected js_open_read, js_open_write, and
        js_open_append to be int functions instead of void functions, allowing
        easy error finding when opening files to read/write.  Updated
        js_open_(read|write) accordingly.  (2000.10.24) 

0.9.05: Added a new feature: kiwi_inbound_process.  This works like 
        kiwi_mid_process, but on all mail accepted by the Kiwi filter.
        Added support for KIWI_FROM environmental variable. (2000.10.23)

0.9.04: Fixed bug where messages with a mid timeout timed out after 
        kiwi_days_long instead of kiwi_days_mid. (2000.10.20)

0.9.03: Updated Spec.html to be current with planned future upgrades, and
        to have a chart of decoded Kiwi cookie values.  (2000.10.19)

0.9.02: Updated Webmailto.html document to reflect Kiwi 2.0 changes.  Some 
        improvments to the setting up of environmental variables 
        (A currently undocumented feature) (2000.10.19)

0.9.01: Fixed Lists.html in docs to reflect changes done for the 2.0 release
        (2000.10.17)

0.9.00: kiwi_mid_process feature has been implemented.  HTML documentation
        has been updated.  Now, the only things that need to be done are
        man pages for all the js_string functions I have made since I last 
        documented those functions, sendmail testing, bug fixes, and doc
        fixes.  Version number jump to reflect the near-complete status
        of the Kiwi2 software suite. (2000.10.17)

0.4.06: Updated documentation to reflect changes done to Kiwi code.
        Added 'make install' to the Makefile.  Once I add the kiwi_mid_process
        feature, and make sure it works with Sendmail, we have a Kiwi-2.0.00 
	release. (2000.10.14)

0.4.05: Sucessfully tested and debugged append feature.  Now all we need
        is kiwi_mid_process feature and updated docs. (2000.10.14)

0.4.04: Ability to append to mailbox added.  Needs to be tested now 
        (2000.10.14)

0.4.03: Fixed bug in adding return-path header. (2000.10.14)

0.4.02: Begin work on appending mailboxes (still not supported).  Fixed bug
        in wrapper where real email address was visible in Return-Path
        header. (2000.10.14)

0.4.01: Fixed bug with the sending of bounce messages.  Now we send autoreplies
        when someone send us mail to a timed out/bad cookie. (2000.10.10)

0.4.00: Debugged forward() routine.  Tweaks to bounce routine, debugged 
        bounce().  At this point, the program is ready for my personal use,
        though not all of the features of kiwi1 are implememted yet
        (notably, we still do not have mid_process nor do we have
         the ability to append cleared mail to a file). (2000.10.10)

0.3.18: Deliver() routine finished.  Forward() routine written. (2000.10.10)

0.3.17: More infilter work.  Finished bounce() routine, working on deliver().
        (2000.10.09)

0.3.16: More infilter work.  Added js_open_append, js_lock, and js_unlock
        calls, which need to be documented.  (2000.10.08)

0.3.15: More infilter work. (2000.10.07)

0.3.14: This job of mine is making infilter work painfully slow...
        (2000.10.05)

0.3.13: More infilter work.  Slowly but surely... (2000.10.04)

0.3.12: More infilter work.  Beginning to process various results of
        reading the headers (2000.10.03)

0.3.11: More infilter work.  The mail header has been read.  Next: Cookie
        processing. (2000.09.28)

0.3.10: More infilter work.  (2000.09.27)

0.3.09: Slowly working on infilter.  This will hopefully be ready
        to debug one of these days (2000.09.27)

0.3.08: First day at my new job.  Set up a bunch of js_string obejcts which
        read their data from kvars.  (2000.09.25)

0.3.07: Hung out with a buddy all weekend.  Preparing to code the infilter
        by writing out, in detailed comments in KiwiMain.c, the exact design
        for the input filter.  (2000.09.24)

0.3.06: Debugged parseaddress routine.  Beginning work on the main input
        filter. (2000.09.21)

0.3.05: Added COOKIE_SIZE #define to KiwiMain, to eventually support
        longer cookies (the data will stay 32-bit for now).  Finished up
        parseaddress routine, which needs to be debugged.
        (2000.09.20)

0.3.04: Began work on infilter.  Wrote getaddress routine, which is more
        elegant and rfc-compliant than the one I wrote for kiwi1. 
        Wrote regression test which verified that getaddress works properly.
        (2000.09.18)

0.3.03: wrapper now sets the KIWI_STATUS environmental variable to have a
        value of "OUTGOING" (2000.09.17)

0.3.02: Added exit(0) at end of wrapper function, so that the MUA doesn't 
        complain, which it may do w/o exiting with a 0.  Makefile cleanup.
        (2000.09.14)

0.3.01: Opps!  Fixed error in Makefile, suite fully compiles again.
        (2000.09.14)

0.3.00: I had a nice vacation with family in San Diego.  Wrapper now works.  
        Fixed bug in KiwiMain.c w.r.t. Argv[0] parsing.  (2000.09.14)

0.2.03: Added js_tolower function, needs to be decumented.  Continued work
        on the outgoing sendmail wrapper. (2000.09.08)

0.2.02: clicrypt now compiles again, corrected syntax errors. (2000.09.08)

0.2.01: Began work on adapting the Kiwi1 wrapper code to the kiwi2 js_string
        and .kiwirc framework. (2000.09.07)

0.2.00: Finished adding ability to decode cookies on command line.  Bumping
        version number up one to reflect this. (2000.09.06)

0.1.03: Fixed bug in js_getline_stdin.  Adding ability to decode cookies
        on the command line (2000.09.04)

0.1.02: Updated js_create to return 0 on error instead of -1 (update docs).
        Added js_val function (yet another function to document).  clicrypt
        now has ability to encrypt 5-letter messages.  IP encryption now
        checks to make sure ip is in a.b.c.d notation.
        (2000.09.04)

0.1.01: Improved argv[0] parsing so that it ignores any path leading to the
        command.  Added support for it to process ip numbers, added js_atoi 
        function (needs to be documented)
        (2000.09.03)

0.1.00: First release with real functionality.  This one reads data from a
        .kiwirc file (the key, in this case) and is able to act like 
        cryptday from Kiwi1, generating compatible cookie.  Bumped up minor
        revision number to reflect existance of real functionality.
        (2000.09.01)

0.0.33: Fixed some bugs in KiwiMain.c.  Right now, Kiwi2 has almost the
        functionality of the "cryptday" program in Kiwi1, along with the
        ability to read a .kiwirc file and a safer string library.
        (2000.08.31)

0.0.32: Begin work on KiwiMain.c.  Added support for returning error number
        (via pointer) in read_kiwirc function. (2000.08.30)

0.0.31: read_kiwirc function created and debugged.  kiwi_goodjs has 
        js_encoding test, returns fatal error if encoding is not JS_US_ASCII.
        (2000.08.29)

0.0.30: KiwiParse is even more pedantic.  Added functions that will allow
        simple reading/writing of variables that kiwi will use in its 
        running.  Added function that tries to locate the .kiwirc file
        (2000.08.28)

0.0.29: New routines that need to be documented: js_nonmatch, and 
        js_nonmatch_offset.  KiwiParse is now far more pedantic, not
        allowing unknown characters, an unknown number of quotes, etc.
        Next: Write a routine that will parse lines from a kiwirc file,
        and store the data thusly, making a note of lines that return
        syntax errors. (2000.08.25)

0.0.28: Continuing work on plugging up memory leaks, which actually
        started as I was hunting down the bug the turned out to be in
        js_match_offset.  Made KiwiParse more pedantic:  It now refuses
        to allow multiple barewords before an equals sign.  Began work
        on a js_nonmatch-style routines in JessStr.c (2000.08.25)

0.0.27: Whoo hoo! KiwiParse.c works!  The bug fixes were rather minor, with
        the exception of a bug in js_match_offset that looked for matches
        one character beyond the end of the string.  Added parsetest.c, 
        which makes sure parseline works as it should.
        (2000.08.24)

0.0.26: KiwiParse.c is finished being written, and now compiles.  Next, I have
        to set up a bugtest for it.  (2000.08.24)

0.0.25: More work on KiwiParse.c.  Looks like I am almost done with being
        able to parse a single line of text in the kiwirc file.
        (2000.08.23)

0.0.24: Further work on KiwiParse.c.  Added function js_length to 
        JessStr.c.  (2000.08.23)

0.0.23: KiwiJS.c JessStrOS.c now actually compile (again).  Cheanged return
        value when routines can not allocate memory from -1 to 0, since 0
        is defined by the C language as the null pointer.  Reorganized files
        for the up and coming near-complete rewrite of the Kiwi program.
        Updated specification to have two new values for the decoded Kiwi
        cookie: 0x00000000: An error occured when decoding the Kiwi cookie,
        and 0x00000001: The Kiwi cookie is invalid (Bad parity, etc.)
        Started work on KiwiParse program.  (2000.08.22)

0.0.22: Corrected some of the groff code by looking at the -man macros
        with "man groff_man".  Added a new set of routines: KiwiJS.c,
        which has all of the core Kiwi encrypt/decrypt routines in
        a js_string-friendly format.  Added js_qstr2js routine (needs
        man page) (2000.08.20)

0.0.21: Added and documented a couple more routines to the JessStr library:
        js_space_chars and js_getline_stdin.  Corrected mistake in
        js_buf_getline documentation.  Added the JessStr documentation to
        my MANPATH, so I will be constantly looking at and correcting the
        documentation as needed.
        (2000.08.19)

0.0.20: Yipee!  All of the man pages are completed, with some proofreading.
        The troff language of UNIX man pages is enough to drive a man crazy,
        I swear. (2000.08.18)

0.0.19: Have most of the functions in JessStrOS.c written up as man pages.
        Only a handful of man pages to go.  (2000.08.18)

0.0.18: Finished up man pages for the rest of the functions in JessStr.c
        We now have 18 man pages.  Next: The man pages for JessStrOS.c
        and JessStrCP.c functions. (2000.08.18)

0.0.17: Beginning work on man pages.  Made man pages for js_create,
        js_destroy, js_destroy_force, js_get_encode, js_octets,
        js_set_chsize, and js_set_encode. (2000.08.17)

0.0.16: js_buf_getline now looks clean.  I verified that it acts the same,
        regardless of buffer size, and that it doesn't act weird when a 
        newline appears right at the end of a buffer.  Updated JessStr.h
        to have functions prototypes for all functions in the js library.
        Changed the js_buf_getline test in tests.c.  Next: Start writing
        man pages for all of the js functions. (2000.08.17)

0.0.15: Corrected a number of bugs in js_buf_getline.  Works with the simple
        case of a standard text file, but may bug out in certain esoteric
        cases (such as possibly the last character in a buffer being a 
        newline). (2000.08.17)

0.0.14: Enjoyed the LinuxWorld Expo yesterday (I call it the Linux carnival).
        Corrected bug in js_set_chsize which could cause overflows.  Added 
        js_newline_chars, js_copy, js_buf_getline, js_buf_read, and the 
        number and eof values to the js_file structure.
        (2000.08.16)

0.0.13: Added js_read, js_write, and js_close.  Added JS_ERROR and JS_SUCCESS
        as #define constants.
        (2000.08.14)

0.0.12: Changed name JessicaString to js_string (makes typing easier)
        Added js_js2str, js_open, js_open_read, and js_open_write
        (2000.08.14)

0.0.11: Updated kiwi-specific files to come from kiwi-1.2.01, the most recent
        kiwi-1.x.x release. Added js_substr function.  Added
        multi-octet tests, and test for js_substr function. (2000.08.11)

0.0.10: More regression tests on the match library, added publish script to 
        make copying this file to my web server easier. (2000.08.11)

0.0.09: Some more regression tests, bug fixes in js_fgrep_offset and
        js_insert (one too many "+ counter" thingys in the core loops)
        as a result of bugs the regression tests are making appear.
        (2000.08.11)

0.0.08: Beginning the various regression tests for the Jessica String 
        library. (2000.08.10)

0.0.07: Yipee! The Jessica String library compiles!  Makefile added, corrected
        all the minor syntax errors that gave it compile warnings or errors.
        Now, I need to build up a test suite to make sure the string library
        works. (2000.08.08)

0.0.06: Even more enhancments to the JessicaString library.  I am ready
        to set up some regression tests for the string library (2000.08.08)

0.0.05: More enhancments to the JessicaString library.  One of these days,
        this will be usable. (2000.08.08)

0.0.04: Adding support for JessicaString library: A secure library so I 
        don't have to constantly worry about buffer overflows (2000.08.05)

0.0.03: Setup example kiwirc file for up and coming kiwi rc file which will
	allow runtime changing of parameters.  Wrote perl script to change
	legacy Kiwi config.h file to new kiwirc file (2000.07.??)

0.0.02: Starting to code up Palm Pilot client support.  Export regs are no
        more, so I am making this publically available.  Cleaned up Makefile
        for legacy Kiwi in src. (2000.07.06)

Kiwi2:  Made it so we can have version of the scramble and unscramble routines
        which allow the key itself to be changed.  This will be used in a 
        server-side authentication mechanism (the client will still precompute
        the P boxes and S boxes)

1.2.01: Fixed spelling errors in Bouncemail documentation. (Done 2000.07.06)

1.2.00: Made sendmail wrapper properly wait() for sendmail to exit, so
        we don't get zombies.  Made "Content-.*" and "Subject" headers
        not add Kiwi cookies to email addresses.  Added documentation 
        for BOUNCEMAIL feature. (Done 2000.07.06)

1.1.01: Made cookies case-insensitive.  Made all main()s return ints so
        RH6.2 gcc does not complain about main() returning a void.
        (Done 2000.05.21)

1.1.00: Added support for BOUNCEMAIL--the ability to send people a bounce
        message should a kiwi cookie be rejected. (Done 2000.05.12)

1.0.04: Changed CHANGELOG to have newest changes at top of list.  Updated
        FAQ to reflect the fact that the ITAR anti-crypto laws are no more.
        (Done 2000.05.11)

1.0.03: Yipee!  As I understand it, the !@#$ ITAR regulations are no more.
        This program can now be made freely available.  I have added support
        for one-time passwords to the spec (which won't be used by the email
        package, per se)

1.0.02: Argh....we can not distribute this internationally yet (sigh), so I
        changed the docs back.  I also have cleaned up some of the bugs in
	infilter.c (removed the last double-last-line bug), and improved the
	error handling (sendmail and usenet filter pipes now look for
	errors when a write is done).

1.0.01: Changed Intro.html to reflect the fact that Kiwi can now be 
        internationally distributed.

1.0.00: Fixed bug that caused last line of message filtered by Kiwi to
        be printed twice.  Changed documentation to reflect the fact that
	I can now distribute the source code to Kiwi internationally.

0.9.0:  Added question and answer #4 to FAQ.  Begin documentation freeze--the
        only changes to the documentation will be corrections, and additional
	questions and answers in the FAQ.

0.8.14: Added man-page style documentation.  Added Lists.html link to 
        Intro.html.  Made FILES current.

0.8.13: Fixed bug where outgoing mail wrapper did not correctly hanldle
        multi-line "To" and "Cc" headers.

0.8.12: Added MID_PROCESS feature.  I know I promised no new features,
        but realized that this feature was essential for Kiwi to function
        as an effective Spam-fighting tool.  This feature allows mail sent
        in reply to Usenet posts to be more heavily filtered.  Changed
        documentation to reflect existance of new feature.

0.8.11: Made revisions to Webmailto.html.  Added 'make install' to make
        documentation easier to understand.  Gave src/ directory 700
        perms.  Modified documentation to Start.html to reflect the
        the use of make install.  Added statement of being under no
        warranty in the file WARNINGS.  Updated other documentation files
        to reflect existance of Webmailto.html file.  Ran documentation
        through spell checker--only a few misspelled words.  Added
        Lists.html file, which describes how to use msgcrypt for permanent
        email address used to subscribe to mailing lists.

0.8.10: Added new document called Webmailto.html, which talks about
        placing Kiwi-enabled addresses on web pages.

0.8.9: Index added to Start.html, other documentation cleanups.
       Index added to Files.html and made in to a "Quick start" guide.

0.8.8: Updated FILES to be current.  Corrected formatting errors in 
       Start.html, and updated Intro.html to have pointer to Start.html

0.8.7: Changed infilter program to have error checking when opening and
       writing to an incoming mailbox.

0.8.6: Added Start.html document, which is a guide that walks someone
       through enabling their email account to have Kiwi capabilities.
       Made minor correction to Spec.html document.  Gave html and text
       documentation separate directories.

0.8.5: Added SUNOS.patch file which can be used to compile Kiwi on SunOs 
       machines (Tested on a SunOs 4.1.4 system with Gcc 2.5.8).  Patched
       wrapper.c to not munge "Bcc" and "In-Reply-To" lines, and to use
       appropriate "received" line to see just what "+" email address message
       was delivered to on Sendmail systems.

0.8.4: Added comments to the source code.  Added a full description of
       the Kiwi specification, complete with test vectors, to the 
       documentation, and converted the specification into HTML.
       Fixed bug in Makefile where scramble.c was not dependent on
       make_scramble.c.  Makefile added to doc directory, to make
       updating the text files (based on the html files) automatic.
       Added Faq to documentation.

0.8.3: Fixed Makefile to remove cryptdate.o object file when "make clean"
       is invoked.

0.8.2: Did code cleanup, making cryptdate function instead of having each
       program that needs to make an encrypted cookie recycle the same "add
       parity, encrypt, and convert to ASCII" code.  Added comments to code.

0.8.1: Added KUDOS files, where I give credit to people whose ideas made
       Kiwi possible.  Rearranged program in to directories for source,
       tools, and documentation, and updating FILES to reflect the changes.
       Updated and added documentation. 

0.8.0: Fixed bug where PASSWORD had to be defined, workaround added so
       PASSWORD does not need to be defined.  Fixed bug where encryption
       key was directly visible in the binary compile of all programs (now
       that the key schedule setup is done during compile time, there is no
       need for the key to be in the binaries).  Fixed bug where program
       would cause a broken pipe in certain circumstances.  General code 
       cleanup and improved commenting.

0.7.3: Fixed bug where Kiwi would not follow the Blowfish specification 
       with passwords longer than 28 characters.  Added support for
       PASSWORD, so people can have email addresses like 
       name+hello@domain.com, which they can give to friends.
       Started code freeze--no new features will be added until after
       kiwi-1.0.0 is released, and the only changes will be bug fixes and
       improved documentation.

0.7.2: Made Blowfish key setup no longer use OpenBSD source code.  All of 
       the files included with Kiwi are now public domain.

0.7.1: Fixed some bugs in the Makefile, and a bug in infilter.c where mail
       previously delivered to a Qmail system would not get delivered.  
       Updated FILES, SPECIFICATION, and RELEASE to be current.

0.7.0: Sped up encoding/decoding of data by recomputing subkeys and sboxes
       at compile time, this also uses no OpenBSD routines in code. (Except
       for the code that calculates the subkeys and sboxes.)

0.6.6: Fixed a bug that direct file append would not correctly put
       the "Delivered-To" line in the headers when using a QMAIL system

0.6.5: Added support for five-letter message data type.
       config.h separated from kiwi.h header file.
