This is a program designed to deliver mail on /var/spool/mail-based
systems in a secure manner.  This program accepts input from the
standard input, and appends the standard input to the file
/var/spool/mail/{username}, where {username} is the username of the 
process which invokes dropmail.  

For security reasons, the mail spool directory is hardcoded in to the
dropmail binary.  Please change the dropmail.h file before compiling 
dropmail if using a system which places mail in a different directory 
than /var/spool/mail.

The resulting binary dropmail needs to have the minimum necessary
privledge on your system to create new files in /var/spool/mail/
On many systems, it will have 6755 permissions (group SUID), and
be a member of the "mail" group.

Once these elevated privledges are set up, dropmail should probably
be placed in /usr/local/bin (or wherever you place binaries with
elevated privledges).

If you are running a Qmail system, there is no need to compile this
binary.
