Please, *Please* change the key in the src/config.h file.  The src/secpass 
perl script will generate a suitable password on systems with /dev/random

In addition, please change the PASSWORD to something besides "changeme", if
you choose to have a password (red the documentation for details on this)

Since there really is no "off the shelf" block cipher with 32-bit block sizes,
I have opted to modify the Blowfish cipher to use 32-bit blocks.

This version of Blowfish is described by Bruce Schneier as being "not 
recommended for actual implementation".

Hopefully, the emergence of Hasty Pudding will encourage the development and
cryptanalysis of other ciphers with support for a truly variable block
size.

Don't encrypt your 18-gig hard disk with this cipher--anyone with 2^32 known
plaintexts knows all plaintext-ciphertext pairs.  2^32 plaintexts translates
in to 16 gigs of data.

Also, do not post more than 4 billion news articles or send more than 4 
billion emails with this program.  If you find yourself sending out that 
amount of email, you may have an internet addiction problem.
