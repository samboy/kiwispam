I would like to thank the following people, without whose help the Kiwi 
project would not have been possible:

Bruce Schneier, who created the Blowfish encryption algolryhtm, a version
of which I based the 32-bit block cipher used here on.

Niels Provos (with advice from David Mazieres), who implemented the
OpenBSD version of Blowfish that I used in early versions of Kiwi,
and based my encryption code on.

Of course, any errors in the Kiwi suite are my own errors.

D.J. Bernstein and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, whose legal efforts
made releasing this source code to the world possible. (Thank you for Qmail,
too)
