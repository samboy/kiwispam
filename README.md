This program is a fully-functional Spam-protection software suite. Unlike
most spam protection programs, which work using blacklists, and are
ineffective against "Hit and run" spammers, this package works by
changing the email address every time it is made public.

Email addresses can time out after a certain time period (useful when
sending out email or posting to usenet), tell us which IP someone got
our email address from on a web page (useful for finding spambots),
or contain a terse description of where we made the email address public.

This program is released to the public domain, which makes it compatible
with all of the open-source licenses out there.

This code was written between 1998 and 2001; development was stopped
on October 17, 2001.
